Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is a branch of computer since that deals with the design developmetnt and maintenance of software application.
it helps create software that is reliable, efficient and scalable.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
phisical, social, emotional . the first nato software engineering is conferance is held  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning -defining the proect scope, goals and overall stratergy
Disign- creating software architecture 
testing - thoroughly evaluting the software toidentufy and fix bugs

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequential approach where each project phase must be completed before moving to the next while Agile is an aterative approach that allows fot flexibility and continouos adaptation to changing requirements, with work delivered in smaller increments and frequent feedback loops thruoghout the develpoment process 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer designs and maintain software using many diffent skills and tool
Quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring that a product, typically software meets all quality standard by over seeing the entire development process.their roles include defigning quality requirements, creating test plans and reporting any disscrepancies
Project manger is responsible for planning,organising and overseeing the execution of a project. their roles include defining project scope 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated development environment they consolidate various tools like cood editors, complilers and version controls stytems into a single platform
Version control systems they enable efficient collaboration by tracking changes made to code over time, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. eg backup 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
they fae challenges like keeping up with rapidly evolving technology, ensuring security and preventing burnout. To overcome this they can focus on continuous learning, adapting structured debugging practicals and prioritizing work life balance

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - test individuals units of code to ensure they behave as expected. their importance catches early bugs,helps developers enderstand code logic and improves overall code quality
Integration testing - checks how different units interact when combined together. their importance is to adentify issues related to data flow between components ans ensures intergration

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Lack of specifics- they dont provide enough details about what should be included in the response.
the improved prompt is consided more effective because it provides clear instructions, relevent context and specific details
